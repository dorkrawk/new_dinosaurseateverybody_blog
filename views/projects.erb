    A Ruby gem for building genetic algorithms.  I think genetic algorithms are fun and I wanted to learn how to build Ruby gems.  This seemed like the obvious way to go.

    I like using <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> to track my running and other workouts, but as of now they don't have a public API.  I wanted to be able to play around with some of my data so I built a rough API that returns JSON data about running related workouts given a username.  I also used this project to start learning about <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="The Ruby web framework, not the lounge singer.">Sinatra</a>.

    This is a Sinatra app using the <a href="https://github.com/tweetstream/tweetstream">TweetStream</a> gem to continuously listen for interactive Twitter events by a set of users on another set of users. This was built for a specific project for listening to fan interactions with bands but could easily be generalized to other such interactor/interactee events.  It's set to periodically repull Twitter usernames from a remote database so that the events stay up to date with a dynamic system.

    Mount Saint Awesome is my webcomic.  I started drawing it a few years ago and it's been a lot of fun.  I was very consistent on my once a week updates for a long time, but recent life craziness has severely cut into my update schedule.
