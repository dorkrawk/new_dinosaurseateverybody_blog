<p>I have been in and out of bands since the 5th grade.  Some of those bands/musical projects and have been more serious or longer lived than others, but I will attempt to catalog a good portion of my musical history here.</p>

    Sometimes I do some recording and or songwriting on my own, particularly since I've moved to California, leaving my bands and longtime musical collaborators back in Chicago.
