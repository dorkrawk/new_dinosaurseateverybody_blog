So once again I participated in [Inktober](http://inktober.com/) this year, trying to do a drawing every day of October based on the provided prompts. I only got 12 days in this year but I was pretty happy with the results. I felt like they turned out better than [last year's drawings](http://dinosaurseateverybody.com/blog/inktober-2015) and I guess that's always the goal.

I think my favorites from this group are the lonely space man, the tired dad, and the girl with her lizard.

The prompts for the drawings I did (in order) are: hungry, sad, hidden, jump, worried, scared, wet, escape, squeeze, tired, box, and friend.

I also posted these to [Mount Saint Awesome](http://mountsaintawesome.com/comic.php?id=113), just so I don't completely forget that I have a comic.
