On May 25th of last year I started keeping track of my focused practice time for a few things I wanted to get better at. As mentioned in [this post](../blog/input-coffee-v2), I was motivated by reading **Make It Stick** and the idea that getting better at something didn't always feel like progress simply because it should be hard.

I built a really basic time tracking tool, which turned out to be a really strong motivator. Seeing a graph of my practice time each week made me want to keep focused.  Here's the graph from the past year:

I didn't do as much as I had hoped but I feel like I made some decent progress.  My final numbers were:

**guitar: 81 hours** (128 posts)

**art: 21 hours** (39 posts)

**chess: 5 hours** (10 posts)

**vocals: 1 hour** (2 posts)

Obviously I wasn't that focused on vocals and I kind of gave up on chess pretty quickly, but I made a decent showing for guitar work.

I didn't let myself count noodling while watching TV or going to band practice. This had to be focused practice where I was really trying to learn something new or fix something sloppy or work on a skill I was lacking. I would have liked to hit 100 hours but 81 is still a lot more than I've put in any year prior.

Art was a mild success. I did count my time doing [Inktober](../blog/inktober-2015) because a lot of that was drawing novel subjects, but a lot of the other work was fundamental practice and sketchbook work. I also spent some time ramping up with drawing digitally, which I now use a lot for [Look At Me I'm a Racecar](http://lookatmeimaracecar.tumblr.com) comics.

This Input Coffee project has really been helpful in getting me to work on skills that I actually care about. Over the next year I'd like to hit 100 hours of guitar and branch out a bit to some under-practiced skills I'd like to have.
