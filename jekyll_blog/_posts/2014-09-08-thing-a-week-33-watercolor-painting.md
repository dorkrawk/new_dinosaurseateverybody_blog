This week I'll take a break from talking about [RecLaboratory](http://www.reclaboratory.com) stuff and talk about art. This week I started playing around with watercolors.

One of my favorite cartoonists, [Mitch Clem](http://mitchclem.tumblr.com/), has been working with his wife(?), [Amanda](http://nationofamanda.tumblr.com/) to use watercolors in his comics for a while. They've done some really cool stuff in both [color](http://mitchclem.tumblr.com/post/20382657189/nationofamanda-mitch-drew-this-i-painted-it) and [black and white](http://38.media.tumblr.com/8fe73051e12fef257a7d7cd4284cea14/tumblr_n2cdcqm9yL1qdt757o1_1280.jpg).  I've seen other comic artists do it too and I've always loved the effect.

After a trip to the [Walt Disney Museum](http://www.waltdisney.org/), particularly the [Mary Blair exhibit](http://www.waltdisney.org/mary-blair), with Eileen I was really inspired to try painting something so we went to the art store later that weekend and picked up some supplies. As a first project I wrote a short (questionably funny/comprehensible) [comic](http://mountsaintawesome.com/comic.php?id=89) and tried to paint that.  The result was pretty cool, for my first time, and a lot of fun to do. It was a bit tricky working with watercolors in such a small size (the panels were maybe 2" x 3") but I learned a bit and really enjoyed the medium.

Then over the weekend I wanted to do a single scene and had the idea of just doing a simple girl playing guitar on stage. After watching a whole season of Inkmaster I decided to throw a few tattoos on her, as well. I am particularly proud of the hands in this piece. Usually I just give up and let the hands sort of fall apart, especially on guitars but I thought these turned out well. I'm really happy with how this turned out and I plan to keep working with watercolors in the future.
