Once again I didn't have a great Thing a Week week. I actually didn't even get to the point of planning a project for the week. But I did accomplish one thing: **I got a new job**.

I spent a bunch of time this week prepping for and going on interviews and on Thursday I accepted a position as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer at [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.org/). Today was my first day and so far it's an awesome gig. The office is amazing, it's full of dogs, and I get lunch and dinner provided everyday by the staff chefs. The work seems like it will be a lot of fun too. I'm doing Rails development and it seems like I'll be able to have a lot of say in how the product gets architected.

While it wasn't the most productive Thing a Week week, getting a new job certainly qualifies this as a pretty productive life week.
