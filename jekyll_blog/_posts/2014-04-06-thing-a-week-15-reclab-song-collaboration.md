Once again this was another week where my main productivity was with RecLab. I'm back to mainly working on the Rails application now, focusing on building out some of the song access features.

Our big breakthrough this week was being able to actually collaborate on a song using RecLab. Bobby and I were able to record tracks on our individual computers, create new tracks in RecLab, and combine them together into a song. The process was pretty clunky and the interface is still very sparse but it felt like a big step to use the product for its intended purpose.

There is still lot of work to be done before we can even start letting other people try the product but hitting these little milestones feels good.
