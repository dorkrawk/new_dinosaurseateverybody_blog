So this week was not a good Thing a Week week. I had planned to build the Instragram listener to go along with the Bird Watcher project I was working on a few weeks ago, but I ended up sort of bouncing around between a few ideas instead. This is a bit against the "Thing a Week" idea where I complete something every week rather than randomly playing around with stuff to no clear end.

That said I did git a bit of work done in a few areas. 

I started the Instagram work and learned a bit more about how their streaming API works. It looks like I'll need to build a callback endpoint to take in post info and store things in a database and then Instagram will handle most of the hard work. I'll probably just end up building the callback endpoint as part of the exiting daveandeileen.com [Sinatra application](https://github.com/dorkrawk/daveandeileen_site).

I also spent some time doing a bit of research on audio processing libraries for another project I'm planning. As of now I'm leaning towards [PyDub](http://pydub.com/). Hopefully I'll have some work from that project to post soon.

Finally, I'm planning to build a ring box for our wedding out of an old book (kind of like [this](http://cdn0.pairswellwithfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Pommes-Frites-Flask-Book-Holder.jpg), but with wedding rings). I was able to find a book I like at a used bookstore this weekend, so I consider that a small win.

This wasn't a great Thing a Week week, but at least I got a few productive things done.
