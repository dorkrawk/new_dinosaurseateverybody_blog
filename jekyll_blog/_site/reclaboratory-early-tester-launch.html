<p>Unfortunately I&#39;ve broken my &quot;Thing a Week&quot; streak due to some busy weeks where I just didn&#39;t have time to make much of anything. I did, however, have time to clean up some of the last few things for the <strong>RecLaboratory early tester launch</strong>. Bobby and I spent last Tuesday fixing bugs and cleaning up the UI to get RecLab to a place where we were happy enough to let other people check it out.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean it is complete or bug-free by any means. I&#39;m sure there a lots of little rough spots and the UI, while not terrible, is still pretty bare-bones. But our goal for this &quot;release&quot; was to get the site to a point where we could show some friends and let them try things out. We really just want to see if we&#39;re headed in the right direction with what we have so far before we devote a lot of time to polishing the UI and the code base.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty exciting to finally start showing off something we&#39;ve been working on for a long time (on and off for about 6 months now). While it&#39;s kind of nerve-wracking to worry about something breaking now that people other than Bobby and I are on the site it&#39;ll be fun to see how people start to use what we&#39;ve built. We&#39;re rolling out invites <em>very</em> slowly as we become more confident about the feature set and stability of the system.</p>

<p>I also started a <a href="http://reclaboratory.tumblr.com/">RecLab Blog</a> (my first Tumblr account!) to act as a sort of company blog now that we&#39;re trying to involve other people in the site. As always you should follow/friend/read/whatever our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reclaboratory">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reclaboratory">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/reclaboratory">Instagram</a>, and <a href="http://reclaboratory.tumblr.com/">blog</a>. </p>
