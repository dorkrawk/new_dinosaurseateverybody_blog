<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 1 - Professor Rex VonScience Saves The World (an HTML5/JavaScript game)</h2>

<p>So, the first Thing A Week project was kind of a failure. </p>

<p>My goal was to build my first HTML5/JavaScript based game. I started out by picking a JS game framework suggested by my buddy <a href="http://www.urgack.com/">Bryan</a>. I ended up using <a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Crafty</a> and getting started with <a href="http://buildnewgames.com/introduction-to-crafty/">this tutorial</a>. It was really good and by the end I had a top down adventure game thing that looked very Zelda-like.</p>

<p>From there I sat down and did a bit of planning to figure out what sort of game I wanted to make. This is where I may have gotten a bit ambitious. I decided to make a top down adventure game (similar to the one in the tutorial) about a T-rex/scientist who must fight off mammals and time travelers to gather parts to build a spaceship and blow up the asteroid that will cause the mass extinction of all dinosaurs. I planned out 4 stages, each with new mobs and planned to hand draw all the sprite fames.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was in a bit over my head, having never built a game before.</p>

<p>In the end, I was able to create a rather buggy game where you can move around a dark green square in a forest (made of light green squares) and go after gray squares (the parts!) while avoiding some brown squares (probably a rodent of some kind?). I wouldn&#39;t really call it a game, but I suppose I know a lot more about game building with JavaScript than I did last week. I did really like the idea for the game, especially the name &quot;Professor Rex VonScience&quot; and I got to draw several dinosaurs wearing a lab coat and a bow tie, so it wasn&#39;t a total loss.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to &quot;play&quot; the &quot;game&quot; you can take a look here: <a href="../stuff/prof_rex_vonscience/index.html">Professor Rex VonScience Saves The World</a> and the code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/prof_rex_vonscience">Github</a>.</p>

<p>So, now that I&#39;ve already had an unsuccessful Thing A Week week, I need to figure out how to deal with failure in the project. I&#39;d like to keep working on this game but I&#39;d also like to avoid sticking with the same project several weeks in a row, particularly this early. Perhaps in an upcoming week I&#39;ll pick a subset of this game as my project and work from there now that I have a better idea about the kind of work it takes to make a game. I&#39;m also not sure if I&#39;m ready to set next week&#39;s project yet. I&#39;m leaning towards building a bass distortion pedal, though.</p>
