<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 6 - Piano and Bass Song</h2>

<p>I think that it&#39;s fair to call this Thing A Week a failure and I don&#39;t really have a great excuse. I set out to write a song that revolved around the piano and bass and I ended up with a nice riff that didn&#39;t go anywhere.</p>

<p>This tends to happen to me a lot. My Garageband folder is full of 30 second long riffs and fleshed out song chunks, but I often hit a wall and I&#39;m not sure where to go from there. Last week I sat down and tried writing some stuff influenced by a couple songs that either did piano and bass or just bass licks well. The main ones I referred to were <a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Ben_Folds_Five/album/The_Sound_Of_The_Life_Of_The_Mind/track/Erase_Me/">Erase Me</a> by Ben Folds Five and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Brand_New/album/Deja_Entendu/track/Sic_Transit_Gloria_..._Glory_Fades/">Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades</a> by Brand New. They are both awesome songs and I especially love the way the piano and bass work together in the Ben Folds song but my ideas just weren&#39;t working. I ended up with some weird meandering minor bass parts thrown over some really weak piano parts.</p>

<p>I came back the next day and switched to a major key and started with the piano part first. From there I came up with something that I liked and wrote a simple bass part that just harmonized the piano roots in a few parts.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s where I got stuck. I spent a bit of time playing around with some sparse guitar parts and a few of the new amp models in the new version of Garageband. I also played around with the new Drummer feature of Garageband. It was pretty cool and maybe the most redeeming quality of Garageband X (the removal of the old keyboard shortcuts and export to mp3 are driving me nuts and might send my back to version 6!). The drum sounds are great and it&#39;s a big step up from the midi drum parts I had been working with in the old version of Garageband, but I did feel a bit uncomfortable with the loss of control over every single hit. I suppose it&#39;s a decent compromise.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I came up with. I ended up just doing some random guitar riffing and bigger chords at some point, but it really just felt forced and didn&#39;t take the song anywhere. Take a listen, though, because the piano/bass part turned out pretty nice: </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to keep working with this song. It&#39;s different than most of the stuff I&#39;ve written lately. I think that throwing lyrics over it will be a bit of a challenge just because I don&#39;t quite trust my voice for something this mellow, but it&#39;s a fun part and I think it could turn into something cool.</p>

<p>This week I&#39;m leaning towards either a project with Python (I&#39;ve been meaning to brush up on my Python for a while) or something artistic. I&#39;m still not quite sure.</p>
