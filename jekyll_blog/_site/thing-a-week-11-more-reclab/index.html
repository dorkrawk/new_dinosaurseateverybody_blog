<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 11 - More RecLab</h2>
<div class="post_date">March 24, 2014</div>

<div class="post">
<p>Once again this week&#39;s work was devoted more to a long term project than to anything that could be finished in 7 days. I put more work into the site and the audio processing tools for RecLab and we&#39;ve been doing some good planning, too.</p>

<p>The site is pretty straight forward Rails, so far. Nothing too out of the ordinary there. I&#39;m starting to get deeper into the music objects and business logic of the site, which is fun. I&#39;ve also been working a bit with Flask as a wrapper around some of the audio processing stuff. After <a href="../blog/thing-a-week-7-flask">Week 7</a> I had been looking for a good Flask project and now I&#39;ve found one! I&#39;ve found some great resources on building good APIs in Flask, such as <a href="http://pycoder.net/bospy/presentation.html">this one</a> which have been really helpful for designing non-trivial stuff. I have a bit of experience building APIs with a micro web framework from building the <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/unofficial-fitocracy-runs-api">Unofficial Fitocracy Runs API</a> in Sinatra, but this will be a bit more complex than that.</p>

<p>Hopefully we&#39;ll have something that I can actually show off soon. We&#39;ll certainly need early testers. I do still hope to have work on a few small projects that I can show off from week to week.</p>
