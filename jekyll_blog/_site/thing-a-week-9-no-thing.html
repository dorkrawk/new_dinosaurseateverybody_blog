<p>So this week was not a good Thing a Week week. I had planned to build the Instragram listener to go along with the Bird Watcher project I was working on a few weeks ago, but I ended up sort of bouncing around between a few ideas instead. This is a bit against the &quot;Thing a Week&quot; idea where I complete something every week rather than randomly playing around with stuff to no clear end.</p>

<p>That said I did git a bit of work done in a few areas. </p>

<p>I started the Instagram work and learned a bit more about how their streaming API works. It looks like I&#39;ll need to build a callback endpoint to take in post info and store things in a database and then Instagram will handle most of the hard work. I&#39;ll probably just end up building the callback endpoint as part of the exiting daveandeileen.com <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/daveandeileen_site">Sinatra application</a>.</p>

<p>I also spent some time doing a bit of research on audio processing libraries for another project I&#39;m planning. As of now I&#39;m leaning towards <a href="http://pydub.com/">PyDub</a>. Hopefully I&#39;ll have some work from that project to post soon.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;m planning to build a ring box for our wedding out of an old book (kind of like <a href="http://cdn0.pairswellwithfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Pommes-Frites-Flask-Book-Holder.jpg">this</a>, but with wedding rings). I was able to find a book I like at a used bookstore this weekend, so I consider that a small win.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t a great Thing a Week week, but at least I got a few productive things done.</p>
