<div class="post">
<p>One of the <a href="http://dinosaurseateverybody.com/blog/darwinning-my-ruby-gem-for-genetic-algorithms">first posts</a> I wrote on the new version of this blog was about my genetic algorithm Ruby gem, <strong>Darwinning</strong>. I actually started building the library back in December of 2012 when I was first learning Ruby and it&#39;s gone through several updates and periods of inactivity. Usually I&#39;ll just add some tests or make a small update when I have some free time. It&#39;s been a pretty casual project. I just didn&#39;t think that there was that much of a need for a Ruby GA library, I just thought it would be fun to make.</p>

<p>Recently I&#39;ve seen a steady stream of people starring and forking the <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/darwinning">Darwinning repo</a> on Github and I&#39;ve received some really thoughtful and helpful pull requests from people, so I wanted to give the library a bit more attention. I had some free time this weekend and used it to finish off a major feature that I had been working on and finally published the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/darwinning">0.1.0 version of the gem</a>!</p>

<p>The major feature I added was the ability to use Darwinning in existing Ruby models via <code>include</code>. This lets you utilize the library in projects that might not be specifically about genetic algorithms.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my dumb, contrived example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;darwinning&#39;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Triple</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Darwinning</span>

  <span class="no">GENE_RANGES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">first_number</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">second_number</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">third_number</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="kp">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:first_number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:second_number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:third_number</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fitness</span>
    <span class="c1"># Try to get the sum of the 3 digits to add up to 100</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first_number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">second_number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">third_number</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">abs</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then you can use some nice built in methods to generate a population of these objects and evolve them towards a fitness goal:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">Triple</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_evolveable?</span>
  <span class="n">triple_pop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Triple</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">build_population</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">triple_pop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">evolve!</span> <span class="c1"># evolve until fitness goal is or generations limit is met</span>

  <span class="n">pp</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Best member: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">triple_pop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_member</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I&#39;ve been having fun working on this project and it&#39;s really cool to see some other people contribute to the project. If you want to play around with the library or have an interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a> just <code>gem install darwinning</code> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/darwinning">Darwinning Github repo</a>. There are always more updates to do, but it felt good to make some progress on this project.</p>
