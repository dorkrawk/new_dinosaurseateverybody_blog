<h2 class="post_title">Input Coffee (v2)</h2>

<p>So back when I was working at Berkeley (and had more free time) I decided to formalize the tracking of some of my skill improvements. These were mainly things like drawing, playing guitar, playing piano, vocals, comptuer science theory, etc. I set up a small WordPress blog called <strong>Input Coffee</strong> and just made posts for every session in order to keep track of what I had been working on. I liked seeing all the posts every month and having a record of what I was doing, but a blog wasn&#39;t the perfect solution. I wanted better ways to add up time per week or month for each type of task.</p>

<p>I decided to start tracking this sort of thing again, partially in response to reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-It-Stick-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013">Make It Stick</a>, and I wanted a simple way to track my practice sessions for things like guitar, chess, drawing, and other stuff I&#39;m working on these days.</p>

<p>I started by just creating Google Docs for each session, which worked fine and helped me not avoid doing real practice by spending a bunch of time building a complex system to track my practice. But then I gave in and built a system to track my practice. Like the original WordPress blog, it&#39;s called <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/input-coffee">Input Coffee</a>.</p>

<p>This system is pretty simplistic, just a Sinatra app that reads some Markdown files and turns them into CoffeePost objects so I can examine them based on tags, subject, date, and a few other fields. The Markdown files use a format very similar to Jekyll&#39;s posts and I just parse out meta data from the little header. 
Here&#39;s an example post:</p>

<pre>
---
date: 2015-07-14
subject: guitar
tags: acoustic electric
hours: 1.0
---

Spent most of this session doing acoustic stuff...
</pre>

<p>I don&#39;t even have this hosted anywhere, I just run a local server when I want to see stats about my practice. Right now I just show total posts/hours (since May 25th, 2015), some breakdowns by subject (guitar, vocals, chess, drawing, etc.), and some numbers for the current and past week</p>

<p>Obviously, I&#39;d like build out some more metrics and it might be fun to make a nicer interface, but for now this works for me and I&#39;ve avoided overly-over engineering the solution.  Being able to track this sort of stuff really helps keep me in good habits.</p>
