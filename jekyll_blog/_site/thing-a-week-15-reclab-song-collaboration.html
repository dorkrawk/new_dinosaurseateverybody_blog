Once again this was another week where my main productivity was with RecLab. I&#39;m back to mainly working on the Rails application now, focusing on building out some of the song access features.</p>

<p>Our big breakthrough this week was being able to actually collaborate on a song using RecLab. Bobby and I were able to record tracks on our individual computers, create new tracks in RecLab, and combine them together into a song. The process was pretty clunky and the interface is still very sparse but it felt like a big step to use the product for its intended purpose.</p>

<p>There is still lot of work to be done before we can even start letting other people try the product but hitting these little milestones feels good.</p>
