<h2 class="post_title">Starting A Skath Band</h2>

<p>Last May I got a txt out of the blue from Dane, a good buddy, great drummer, and former bandmate:</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;Ok dude. Let&#39;s do it: Let&#39;s write a couple of skath songs.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>Dane and I used to play in a ska band called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dorkrawk/sets/captain-supreme">Captain Supreme</a> back in college. After Captain Supreme broke up we joked around about forming a new ska band, dressing up like skeletons, and writing songs about graveyards and monsters and ghosts and stuff. It would be <strong>skath</strong>!</p>

<p>It was a fun idea, but I assumed it would be like all of the other hilarious band ideas I&#39;d had with friends: fun to talk about but we&#39;d never write anything. Well, for whatever reason this was different. I got really excited and we started trading song name ideas: &quot;Grave Danger&quot;, &quot;Escape From Skull City&quot;, &quot;Hearse Chorus Hearse Chorus&quot;, &quot;Spider!? I Barely Know &#39;er!&quot;. In a fit of inspiration I wrote the lyrics to &quot;Grave Danger&quot; on the spot and we started talking about who else we could get involved. That weekend I started writing some music and it seemed like a project that we could really get off the ground.</p>

<p>Eventually I realized that if we wanted to have some actual songs to record, I&#39;d have to get serious about writing. Inspired by Dane&#39;s participation in <a href="https://5amwritersclub.wordpress.com/">#5amwritersclub</a> I decided that I could get up a little early every morning and actually get some creative work done. While I&#39;m not crazy enough to wake up at 5am, I did get up before 7:00 and found 30 minutes to an hour almost every day to make progress on these songs.</p>

<p>It felt really good.</p>

<p>I felt like a musician again and I felt like a songwriter again. Most of the songwriting I had done since leaving The American Autumn was done in single sessions. If I could get a full song out in a night, it didn&#39;t get done. This was different. I struggled through false starts that just wouldn&#39;t come together. I had to figure out how to connect parts that were cool on their own but needed to sound cohesive. I had to arrange a four part horn section without overwriting things. It felt good to put in the work on a creative project.</p>

<p>About six months later I now have three songs demoed: Grave Danger, Escape From Skull City, and Too Ghoul For School. I recorded all the music and vocals myself, using a keyboard for horns and Logic Pro&#39;s drums. Now I&#39;m ready to do real recordings of this. I&#39;ll still play a lot of the instruments, Dane will be doing the drums, and we&#39;ll be getting other people involved to do vocals and other horn parts.</p>

<p>Six months may seem like a long time to write about 10 minutes of music, but I&#39;m really proud that I was able to get these songs written and demoed while having a new baby and a busy job. What are we going to do with this recording? I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t know if the world is clambering for ska songs about ghosts, so I might not quit my day job but that&#39;s ok. I really just want to see these songs exist.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few snippets of the demos:</p>
