<p>Once again I feel like I&#39;m stretching the rules of A Thing a Week (which is ok because I sort of just made them up). This week I focused on starting the website for a new larger project I&#39;ve started working on with a friend. We&#39;re trying to build a good way for musicians to collaborate online. There are a few things out there trying to address something similar to this, but none of them seem to have serious traction and it looks like there&#39;s a lot of room for refinement.</p>

This week we did a lot of planning and architecture for the project and I started building the Rails application for the site. This is my first non-trivial Rails 4 project and it&#39;s been interesting to see some of the little differences. The biggest one I&#39;ve come across so far is the removal of <code>attr_accessible</code> and moving that functionality into the controller. I need to learn a bit more about how that totally works but so far I&#39;ve been able to use a lot of what I learned building Rails 3.2 stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been really impressed with the Rails 4 gem compatibility, as well. Major stuff I like to use such as <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin">Active Admin</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> are all working just fine. Python could <a href="http://python3wos.appspot.com/">learn a lot</a> here!</p>

<p>This week I was able to get the basic site together, make it look nice enough to work in for a while, build basic user/user profile and login functionality, and start building out some of the core business logic for working with recorded tracks. I also started putting together some survey questions so, musician friends, expect to be bugged to be asked questions soon. It might be a little while before we have an actual site for people to try but I&#39;m always interested in talking with people about the idea.</p>

<p>Now I need to balance working on this with doing a couple other single-week projects, especially the stuff that is needed for the wedding.</p>
