<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 27 - Even More Sauropod</h2>
<div class="post_date">July 15, 2014</div>

<div class="post">
<p>Once again, another busy week divided between wedding stuff and side projects.</p>

<p>I spent this week adding more features to the <a href="http://reclaboratory.com">RecLaboratory</a> audio player and I feel like it&#39;s in a pretty good spot for now. Obviously, there&#39;s more I&#39;d like it to do but it&#39;s certainly at a point where it will work for basic track and song playback.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of new features that got added this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual indicators on the in page play buttons to show what is playing in the global player</li>
<li>Some basic layout polish and player styling</li>
<li>Jump forward or back in the audio by clicking on the progress bar</li>
<li>Play/pause using the space bar</li>
<li>Some basic (if clunky) error checking to make sure files loaded</li>
</ul>

<p>One really interesting thing I found this week that I didn&#39;t expect is that audio playback is not interrupted by navigating around the site. If I reload the page the <code>sauropod.audio</code> object is empty and playback stops, but not if I&#39;m just clicking links on the site. I haven&#39;t had time to explore it completely yet but I suspect it has something to do with either the way Rails caches JavaScript or with <a href="https://github.com/rails/turbolinks">TurboLinks</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really happy that is &quot;just works&quot; that way, I was worried that I would have to go back and turn this whole project into a single page app eventually to get uninterrupted playback, so this is a nice win. I do need to spend some time testing things to make sure I understand <strong><em>WHY</em></strong> it works. It seems dangerous to accidentally get a nice feature like this.</p>

<p>Like I said, while Sauropod is still a little rough around the edges, it&#39;s good enough to use for the site. I&#39;m now moving on to fixing up the interface to Rocktopus for audio compression and song bouncing.</p>

<p>This week I&#39;ll be traveling to New York for a friend&#39;s wedding, so my Thing A Week time may be limited. Also I need to eventually finish writing the ceremony script for my wedding or else some people are going to be mad at me...</p>
