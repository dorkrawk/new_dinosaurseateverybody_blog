This week was another mainly RecLab week. Actually I didn&#39;t get much done on the RecLab Rails site outside of updating the look and feel with the new logo we&#39;ve settled on (shown here...). I spent most of my time on our audio processing API, Rocktopus.</p>

<p>The Rocktopus work has been going well. It&#39;s nice to get back into writing some Python again and I&#39;ve been enjoying working with Flask. One of my favorite recent additions is the <code>require_auth</code> decorator. Python decorators are pretty awesome and make it really simple to roll some common functionality into several methods.</p>

<p>This allows me to write Flask endpoints like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/path_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">methods</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'POST'</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nd">@require_auth</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">path_method</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="c"># do a bunch of stuff for this endpoint</span>
  <span class="c"># but make sure the POST body contains the proper authentication</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The decorator itself is pretty simple and works something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">require_auth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nd">@wraps</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wrapped</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_json</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">force</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">validate_auth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">response_arm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">auth_fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c"># return 401</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">wrapped</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Rocktopus is really coming along nicely and I&#39;m really close to getting it hooked up to the Rails site soon.</p>

<p>This week I start my drawing classes. I haven&#39;t had any formal art training since grade school and it seemed time to learn a bit more about drawing, given my interest in comics, so I signed up for a Drawing 101 course at a local art studio. Hopefully I&#39;ll have some cool work from the class over the next few weeks to show off in these posts.</p>
