<p>This week I started something new. I&#39;m taking a Drawing 101 class at <a href="http://rootdivision.org/">Root Division</a> art studio in the Mission. I&#39;ve been <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com">drawing comics</a> for a few years now, it seems like I should start learning how to draw.</p>

<p>The class seems like it&#39;s going to cover the basics and have us work mainly with graphite and charcoal. I think it will be really good for me to take a step back and really learn some of these fundamentals. I haven&#39;t had any formal art training since Jr. High, so I&#39;m about due. I really feel like my comic art has started to hit a wall and I&#39;m having a hard time getting some ideas down on to paper.</p>

<p>The drawing above is the first thing our instructor had us do: first draw an apple from memory, then he put an apple on the table for us to draw. Apples are kind of hard to draw.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&#39;ll have some more impressive work from this class to post in the future.</p>

<p><strong>bonus thing!</strong></p>

<p>Eileen got me a copy of Logic Pro X for my birthday and so the first thing I did with it was play with all the amp models and pile a bunch of guitar parts on top of each other. The <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dorkrawk/guitar-pile">resulting 30 second piece</a> ended up sounding like some kind of epic video game music: </p>
