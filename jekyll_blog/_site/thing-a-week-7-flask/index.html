<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 7 - Flask</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Now, in my defense I was pretty sick for most of last week so I ended up not getting much done outside of work besides a lot of napping. I started with a vague plan to do <em>something</em> with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, the Python micro-webframework and to that end I succeeded in what I set out to do. It had been a while since I had done anything serious with Python and I&#39;ve been feeling the urge to get back into it.</p>

<p>I ended up spending a lot of time just getting my Python development environment set up. Apparently it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve done anything non-trivial in the language that I didn&#39;t even have basic tools set up well on this computer. I wanted to do things right and that took a bit of installing and uninstalling through various channels to get things just so. This meant Python installed threw Homebrew and then using that version of <code>pip</code> to install <code>virtualenv</code>. This way I didn&#39;t have to use <code>sudo</code> to install <code>virtualenv</code>. While this ended up being more frustrating than it should have been (and at one point led to me asking a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21917619/error-with-installing-virtualenv-with-pip-and-homebrew">Stack Overflow question</a> that I later answered for myself) I did get things set up nicely, which is a major win.</p>

<p>Once I got down to setting up Flask thing were pretty smooth. For the basic stuff I was doing it felt very similar to Sinatra, which I&#39;ve worked with quite a bit. I finally got to use Python&#39;s method decorators in practice which was neat (they drive the routing around the functions related to the routes).</p>

<p>The end result was a pretty basic first test site. Nothing really worth putting up anywhere. I&#39;d like to keep playing with Flask and get a bit more reacquainted with Python so unless I have another burning project come up, I might just stick with it this week too.</p>
